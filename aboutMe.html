                    <strong>My name is Grant Lancaster</strong>

                    I'm a chemistry and design student a the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a>
                    I do most of my work in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/">ATLAS Institute</a> which I feel 
                    incredibly lucky to be a part of!
                </p>
                <p id="biography">
                    My goal is to become a UX designer, which is why I joined the program.
                    However, through my courses, I have found a fondness for programming!
                    Web Development is very appealing to me and certainly something I want to
                    engage with in my career.
                </p>
                <p id="biography">
                    As I said before, my design focus is user experience. I have run into many 
                    products that are confusing to use, and it's a little aggravating (especially
                    in the chemistry lab. Seriously, some of those data collection programs are awful!).
                    I want to make products, for the general user, as well as specialty cases, that don't make you want to pour acid on your hand,
                    cause sometimes that would feel better than using some of these programs.
