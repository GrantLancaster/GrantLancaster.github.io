    "aboutme":`Starting off as a chemist, I couldn't find what I was looking for in my work. It lacked creativity, satisfaction, 
    and the ability to say "I built that". I decided to try my hand at the ATLAS Institute at University of Colorado Boulder, 
    and everything changed. 
    <br><br>
    Now I'm a front-end developer making applications for fun, for people, and for exploration; trying out new techniques, designs, 
    and functions. I love front-end, but my main passion is helping people, so I want to use my skills to create projects that 
    enhance people and how they live.
